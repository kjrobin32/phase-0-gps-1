# GPS 1.1 Reflection
Nick Pentella

## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Git and Github were definitely the trickiest parts of week 1 for me.  Specifically, pushing and pulling to GitHub and building good workflow were big challenges for me.  Preparing for and going through this session help a lot!

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Pushing and pulling were definitely clarified and I think going into git fetch was helpful to understand whats going on beneath the surface.  Also, actually going through pull requests with someone else was helpful.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Looking back, I probably should have slowed down to let my peer guide more and ask more questions, so I'll work on that next time.  Mostly I asked the guide for clarification on my understanding and tried to get a feel for how things are done in the real workplace.  I asked my partner about their preferences and made sure they were on the same page with me.

## What still confuses you about Git?
I'm feeling pretty comfortable with the Git concepts we've reviewed so far, but I know there are a lot more features we haven't gotten into.  For example, I'd like to learn more about reverting to previous versions.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Overall, it was a great experience!  For the first GPS, I worked with a friend so that made it a littel less nerve racking, but it will be beneficial to branch out more in the future.  It was a great opportunity to ask some questions of my partner and guide.  The opportunity to explain some concepts to my partner also helped solidify my own understanding.
